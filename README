GSL - GNU Scientific Library and AMPL bindings
==============================================

This is GSL, the GNU Scientific Library, a collection of numerical
routines for scientific computing.

GSL is free software, you can redistribute it and/or modify it under

Availability
============

The current stable version of GSL is always available from ftp.gnu.org
in the directory /pub/gnu/gsl.

A list of mirror sites can be found at http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html

AMPL bindings and CMake support
===============================

This repository adds CMake support and AMPL bindings (AMPLGSL) to the GSL distribution. 
Detailed instructions on how to use CMake to support compilation of GSL can 
be found in the main `CMake build script`__. 

__ https://github.com/ampl/gsl/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt

CMake works by generating native makefiles or project files that can
be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The typical
workflow starts with::

  git clone https://github.com/ampl/gsl.git
  cd gsl
  git submodule init 
  git submodule update
  mkdir build  # Create a directory to hold the build output.
  cd build
  cmake -DARCH=64 ..  # Generate native build scripts.

Please note that if no AMPL bindings are needed,the ASL dependency can be avoided by 
defining the cmake variable `NO_AMPL_BINDINGS`, which can be done by replacing the 
last shell statement with::

  cmake -DARCH=64 -DNO_AMPL_BINDINGS=true ..

Documentation about the AMPL bindings can be found at the `AMPLGSL documentation <http://ampl.github.io/amplgsl>`.

Installation
============

GSL follows the standard GNU installation procedure.  Please consult
the INSTALL file in this distribution for more detailed instructions.

For information about specific platforms and compilers see the
"Compilation Notes" section in the INSTALL file.

More information about GSL
==========================

The project homepage is http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

See the NEWS file for recent changes to the library.

The GSL Manual has been published and can be ordered from most
bookstores. The publication details are,

  GNU Scientific Library Reference Manual - Revised Second Edition, 
  M. Galassi et al, ISBN 0954161734 (620 pages, paperback).

The money raised from sales of the manual helps support the
development of GSL.

A Japanese translation of the reference manual is available from the
GSL website above (thanks to Daisuke TOMINAGA).

Reporting Bugs
==============

A list of known bugs can be found in the BUGS file.  Details of
compilation problems can be found in the INSTALL file.

If you find a bug which is not listed in these files please report it
to bug-gsl@gnu.org.

All bug reports should include:

       The version number of GSL, and where you obtained it.
       The hardware and operating system
       The compiler used, including version number and compilation options
       A description of the bug behaviour
       A short program which reproducibly exercises the bug

It is useful if you can check whether the same problem occurs when the
library is compiled without optimization.  Thank you.

Any errors or omissions in the manual can also be reported to the
same address.
